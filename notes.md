## Page 1 � Core Concepts

### EEG Waves

- **EEG waves = potential difference between two different electrodes.**
- Most instructions given by our brain originate from the **frontal lobe**.

### Two-Model Architecture

Two models are required for research and scalability for the future:

| Model                 | Role                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model 1 (Initial)** | Gets labelled, formatted data for text translation from EEG waves          |
| **Model 2 (Second)**  | Decrypts the **intent** for each statement and understands the **emotion** |

### Reasoning � Language-Independent Thought

> _"We might think in different languages but we think with the same intent. What we say might vary, but what we think cannot � that is the thing that is fundamentally unique, whether you are deaf, dumb, etc."_

- We first get a **thought**, and then we make a **language medium** to communicate that thought.
- The research question: **What if we could communicate without the need of any language?**
  - This is a concept of research, not yet proven, but something we can actually implement.

## Page 2 � Requirements and Expectations

### Expectations

- We are expecting this model to give **fast outputs in millisecond (ms) latency**.
- We need to **minimize latency** of each prediction.
- For such requirements, we need to **tweak both hardware and software** to get the best output.

**Best-case expectation:**

> The model could be trained on a base language first, then implemented with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and be able to **grow and learn new words** with time spent with the user (adaptive/personalised learning).

### Requirements

- **Hardware** must be optimised for:
  - Small form factor
  - Superfast compute power
  - Huge unified shared memory that is **fast-access** and can be directly accessed by CPU or processor used in system

- **Frontal lobe focus:** As most commands and thoughts are generated in the frontal lobe of the brain, our model will mostly focus on the **front to mid** region to decrypt instructions and thoughts.

### Form Factor Options

For **commercial use**, the device can be morphed into everyday objects:

| Form Factor                 | Notes                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cap**                     | General consumer form factor, handy for everyday use |
| **Headband**                | Focused on frontal lobe, tighter fit, precise output |
| **Headset (emotive-style)** | Easy to carry, mostly focuses on frontal lobe        |

- If all electrodes can be concentrated to the frontal lobe, a headband enables a **tighter fit and more precise output**.
- A headset form factor is easy to carry and similarly focuses on the frontal lobe.

### Possible Partnerships

| Partner                 | Area                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotiv**              | Hardware � existing EEG headset manufacturer                                  |
| **OpenBCI Dev Kit**     | Hardware � open-source BCI hardware platform                                  |
| **ElevenLabs (11labs)** | Voice � provides a vast variety of realistic human voices for voiceless users |

- For **voice output** (e.g., giving voice to the voiceless), we may partner with **ElevenLabs** which provides a vast variety of realistic human voices.

## Page 4 � How Could the Dataset Look Like?

### Ideal Dataset Structure � Chunked EEG + Transcripts

The **best and ideal** way to chunk data:

```
[ Multiple EEG waves with timestamps (0:00 to 1:00) ]
          +
[ Transcript: "I am a person" -> mapped to those timestamps ]
```

- This mirrors the same data structure used by **classical voice-to-text generation models**.
- Even classical voice-to-text generation models were trained in the same data structure.

### Multi-User Same-Transcript Approach

For the same transcript (e.g., "I am a boy ... end"), we collect EEG wave data from **multiple users**:

```
Long EEG passage (User 1) ->  [EEG waves]
Long EEG passage (User 2) ->  [EEG waves]
Long EEG passage (User 3) ->  [EEG waves]
```

- **Single Transcript x Multiple Waves** = generalisable pattern learning.

> **Note:** Long-passage single-transcript mapping is **mostly not recommended** because we also
> do not have any means to manually transcribe it to smaller chunks as we do not know
> what a specific wave form segment says within a long passage.

### Summary

| Approach                                   | Recommendation  |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Chunked EEG + timestamp-aligned transcript | Best and Ideal  |
| Long passage EEG + single bulk transcript  | Not recommended |

## Page 5 � Training Process Idea

### Core Idea � Generalise the Wave Pattern

- We **sample out multiple EEG waves for a given transcript** to generalise the wave pattern.
- In human thoughts while reading, there are also **side thoughts** which might vary person to person.
- By sampling for many users, we will try to **reduce the noise** (where noise = side thoughts).

```
Raw Noisy Data -> [User 1 wave] [User 2 wave] [User 3 wave] [User 4 wave]
                           | aggregation
                  [ Generalised waveform ] <- Generalises all the noise
                           |
                  Transcript output
```

- Now, while in use: the wave form which is most similar to this generalised pattern will get the transcript of that wave.

### Scaled / Creative Use Case � Transformer Architecture

- We can also **train with a Transformer architecture model** and predict **n-byte chunks** of the wave.
- Using **LSTM or Transformer architecture** will also help to **sustain longer context** and carry more meaning for each wave chunk.

### Architecture Options

| Architecture              | Benefit                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transformer (chunk-based) | Predicts n-byte wave chunks, scalable                   |
| LSTM                      | Sustains longer context, carries more meaning per chunk |
